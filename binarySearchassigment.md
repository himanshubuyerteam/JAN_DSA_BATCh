Section 1: Normal Binary Search (Easy)
These problems require straightforward application of binary search on a sorted array.
Q1. Binary Search
Given a sorted array of integers, find the index of a target element. Return -1 if not found.
🔗 LeetCode: https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/
Q2. Search Insert Position
Given a sorted array and a target, return the index if found, else return the index where it would be inserted.
🔗 LeetCode: https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position/
Q3. First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array
Find the starting and ending position of a given target in a sorted array.

Q4. Count Occurrences in a Sorted Array
Given a sorted array, count how many times a given element appears.

Q5. Floor and Ceil in Sorted Array
Find the floor (largest element ≤ x) and ceil (smallest element ≥ x) of a given number in a sorted array.

Section 2: Binary Search on Rotated Sorted Array (Medium)
These problems involve applying binary search when the sorted array has been rotated at some pivot.
Q1. Search in Rotated Sorted Array
Given a rotated sorted array with distinct values, search for a target element.
🔗 LeetCode: https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/
Q2. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
Find the minimum element in a rotated sorted array.
🔗 LeetCode: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/
Q3. Search in Rotated Sorted Array II (with duplicates)
Same as Q1 but the array may contain duplicate values. How does this affect your approach?
🔗 LeetCode: https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array-ii/
Q4. Find Rotation Count
Given a rotated sorted array, find how many times it has been rotated.
🔗 GFG: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-rotation-count-rotated-sorted-array/
Q5. Find the Pivot / Rotation Point
Find the index of the pivot element (the largest element before rotation) in a rotated sorted array.
🔗 GFG: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-the-rotation-point-in-a-sorted-rotated-array/

Section 3: Binary Search on Answer (Hard)
These problems don't search in an array directly. Instead, you binary search over the answer space and use a check/feasibility function.
Q1. Koko Eating Bananas
Find the minimum eating speed such that Koko can eat all bananas within h hours.
🔗 LeetCode: https://leetcode.com/problems/koko-eating-bananas/
Q2. Aggressive Cows (Classic Problem)
Place C cows in N stalls such that the minimum distance between any two cows is maximized.
